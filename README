As a matter of policy, I am required to inform the user that this is not an
official Google product.

jmp.sh is a bash 4.x library that enables relative bookmarking of file system
directories including tab completion.  It is not compatible for bash 3.x users
(Sorry Mac users!) because it relies on dictionary data structures only
available in bash 4 and higher. Mac users may be able to upgrade to a
non-default version of bash.

The critical assumption that the library makes is that the root of the directory
structure that you want to bookmark has an identifying name.  For example, you
may have a set of directories

/long_path/foo1/${JMP_ROOT_HINT}/...
/long_path/foo2/${JMP_ROOT_HINT}/...

JMP_ROOT_HINT is the variable you will use to determine the directory root for
relative bookmarking.

To use the library, put the following in your .bashrc:

source ${PATH_TO_LIBRARY}/jmp.sh

export JMP_ROOT_HINT=bar # identify the root of the directory.

setjmp label1 path1
setjmp label2 path2
...

where label1 is a short bookmark label and path 1 is the path relative to
$JMP_ROOT_HINT.  You may omit leading "./" from the path1 and path2 if you want.
